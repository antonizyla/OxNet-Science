    "### Background \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Ae. albopictus* overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This study is based on the mosquito *Aedes albopictus*, also known as the \"tiger mosquito\" due to its stripes. *Ae. aegypti* poses a public health threat, as it is a vector of multiple harmful diseases, such as dengue and Zika Virus. Furthermore, *Ae. albopictus* is a highly invasive species with high ecological plasticity (the ability to to exploit new resources) and physiological plasticity (the ability to physiologically adjust to temperature variation). These traits have allow *Ae. aegypti* to undergo range expansion and persist following environmental modification. In turn, this increase the burden on public healthcare  of diseases carried by *Ae. albopictus*.  As many of the diseases carried by this species have no vaccine, specific treatment or cure, public health interventions rely on controlling the population size of *Ae. albopictus*. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Impact of climate on *Ae. albopictus* population size \n",
    "\n",
    "The mosquito lifcycle has 4 key steps: eggs, larva (juvenille mobile aquatic stage), pupa (less active aquatic stage, floats at the surface of the water), adult. As the mosquito life cycle have two aquatic stages, the availability of aquatic habitats influences adult density. The types of aquatic habitats exploited by *Ae. albopictus* depend on the land use type.  In natural habitats, tree holes and bamboo stumps etc. act as aquatic habitats and in urban areas, artificial containers such as tyres and water storage containers are used. *Ae. albopictus* prefer artificial larval habitats.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"lifecycle.png\" style = \"width:300px; height: 300px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The availability of aquatic habitats is an **unstable** abiotic factor, due to variation in the amount of rainfall and the availability of water vessels. In natural habitats, when there is less rainfall (e.g. during a period of drought), there is a decrease in the number of larval habitats. This is because, the lack of rainfall results in no new larval habitats being formed, and established larval habitats drying out. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this relationship is **more complex** in developing urban areas, where periods of drought can increase the number of larval habitats. This is because, a lack of reliable piped water supply during droughts can increase water storage in buckets, and other open water containers (i.e. containers without a lid). These containers can then act as **larval habitats** for mosquitoes. Thus, periods of drought can result in a surge in the population size of (potentially disease-carrying) mosquitoes in developing urban areas, which can facilitate epidemics. \n",
    "\n",
    "El Nino southern oscillation events cause the strongest natural, interannual, fluctuations in climate, and cause droughts in many regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Question and Hypothesis \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: How does land use impact larval and adult *Ae. albopictus* populations during a drought?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses**\n",
    "In comparison to Natural sites, Human settlements will have:\n",
    "1) More larval habitats \n",
    "2) A greater abundance of *Ae. albopictus* larvae \n",
    "3) A higher density of *Ae. albopictus* adults  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Study Site \n",
    "\n",
    "The study was conducted at the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) Project (https://www.safeproject.net/) in Malaysian Borneo, during an El Nino drought (2019). The SAFE Project is one of the largest ecological experiments in the world, looking at how biodiversity and ecosystem function change as forests are modified by human activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below represents the study sites at the SAFE project. Within this study, two land types were compared: human settlements and natural sites. The human settlements surveyed were within either a logged forest or oil palm landscape. The natural sites were in twice-logged forest, which is either continuous or fragmented. 4 replicates were conducted for each land sub type. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"SAFE.png\" style = \"width:700px; height: 300px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Surveys \n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheses were tested by conducting 3 surveys at each replicate: \n",
    "1) Aquatic habitat survey \n",
    "2) Larval survey \n",
    "3) Adult population surveillance \n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Aquatic habitat survey**\n",
    "For the aquatic habitat survey, in each replicate, **four** 10m^2 areas were surveyed for aquatic habitats. The number of aquatic habitats was recorded, alongside their water volume. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"AHS.png\" style = \"width:400px; height: 300px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Larval survey**\n",
    "A larval survey was conducted on each aquatic habitat. Here, a standardized dipping method was used to determine the arval abundance. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"LS.png\" style = \"width:300px; height: 300px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Adult population surveillance**\n",
    "Human landing catches (HLCs) were used to determine adult abundance. Here, the surveyors act as bait for the mosquitoes. For every mosquito that approaches the surveyer, the surveyer uses an electric aspirator to collect the mosquito (before it bites the surveyer!). Thus, at the end of the collection period, the surveyer has a mosquito-filled container. To allow comparisons of mosquito abundance to be made between replicates, the time of day and length of time surveying is standardised. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"HLC.png\" style = \"width:900px; height: 300px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "**Part 1:**\n",
    "Go through the code below and make the neccessary edits, where specified. There are optional extension parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2:**\n",
    "Produce a 1-2 page scientific report, addressing whether the collected data supports the hypotheses outlined above. The report should include: \n",
    "* Short introduction \n",
    "* Methods (brief overview of how the data were collected, more in-depth dicussion of choice of model / analysis)\n",
    "* Results (including graphs and discussion of model outputs)\n",
    "* Discussion (i.e. put the results in **context**)"

If we left the data of all 0's in the analysis it would not provide valid results, as the Poisson distribution (used for count data) cannot be defined from zeros alone. \n",
